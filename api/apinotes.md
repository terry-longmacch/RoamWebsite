# Important Notes

While effort is always made to maintain API compatibility sometimes things change without knowing the full effect.  If you have used the API of Roam to create plugins or add extra logic to your forms please test before deploying new versions into production.

There is no harm in insstalling many versions of Roam side by side or sharing the config/projects using the ``--profile`` commandline option.  This will let you setup and test new installs and find any issues.
